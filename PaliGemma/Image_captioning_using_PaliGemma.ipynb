        "\n",
        "Image captioning plays a crucial role in making the web accessible to everyone, particularly individuals who are blind or visually impaired. While alternative text (alt text) provides a concise description of an image, captions offer a more comprehensive explanation, conveying the context, details, and nuances that might be missed in a brief alt text. This ensures that all users, regardless of their visual abilities, can fully understand and appreciate the content of images on websites, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable online experience.\n",

        "Now we'll load the PaliGemma model itself. We'll use a preset configuration to streamline the process and ensure we have a compatible model for image captioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today we will be using the **pali_gemma_3b_mix_448** model, which will require our images to be 448x448 pixels... but luckily we can specify this when we load our images later.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Image Size:**\n",
        "  - `_224`: trained and expects input images of size 224x224 pixels. This is suitable for smaller images and less computationally demanding.\n",
        "  - `_448`: trained and expects input images of size 448x448 pixels. This offers a balance between detail and computational cost.\n",
        "  - `_896`: trained and expects input images of size 896x896 pixels. This provides the highest level of detail, but is more computationally intensive.\n",
        "2. **Training Type:**\n",
        "  - `_pt`: *pre-trained* on a large dataset of image-text pairs. It's a good starting point for general image captioning tasks.\n",
        "  - `_mix`: *mix fine-tuned* on a diverse set of vision-language tasks. It's expected to perform well on a wider variety of tasks, but is generally intended for research purposes only.\n",
        "3. **Text Sequence Length:** \\\n",
        "This refers to the maximum length of the generated caption. Presets with higher image sizes usually have longer text sequence lengths as they can potentially provide more detailed descriptions.\n",
