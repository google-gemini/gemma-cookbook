        "## Fine-Tuning Gemma for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with JORA\n",
        "\n",
        "Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for retrieval-based tasks, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), poses significant memory challenges, especially when fine-tuning extensive prompt sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Existing open-source libraries support full-model inference and fine-tuning across multiple GPUs but often fall short in efficiently distributing parameters required for retrieved context. To address this limitation, [JORA](https://github.com/aniquetahir/JORA) introduced a novel framework for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Llama/Gemma models using distributed training, leveraging [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This framework uniquely utilizes JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and tensor-sharding for efficient resource management, enabling accelerated fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs for complex RAG applications, even on systems with limited GPU resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiments demonstrate more than **12x improvement in runtime** compared to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer)/[DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) implementations with four GPUs while consuming less than half the VRAM per GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, you will understand the end-to-end process of fine-tuning a [Gemma](https://github.com/google/gemma) model using JORA and converting the trained model back to the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) format for inference.\n",
