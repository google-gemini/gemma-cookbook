        "[Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open-source language models from Google.

Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop, or your cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state-of-the-art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
