    "# Fine-tuning Gemma for Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this step-by-step guide on fine-tuning the [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) for Function Calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Gemma**](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop, or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function calling finetuning** is a crucial step in enhancing the performance of LLMs with function calling capabilities. It involves training the model on a dataset of prompts and corresponding function calls, enabling it to accurately identify the appropriate function for a given task. By fine-tuning the model, it learns to better understand the nuances of natural language, recognize the intent behind prompts, and select the most suitable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses [Torch XLA](https://github.com/pytorch/xla) and Hugging Face's [**Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL)**](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) framework for Function calling finetuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Torch XLA**](https://pytorch.org/xla/) enables you to leverage the computational power of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for efficient training of deep learning models. By interfacing PyTorch with the [XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)](https://openxla.org/xla) compiler, Torch XLA translates PyTorch operations into XLA operations that can be executed on TPUs. This means you can write your models in PyTorch as usual, and Torch XLA handles the underlying computations to run them efficiently on TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL)**](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) is a framework developed by Hugging Face to fine-tune and align both transformer language and diffusion models using methods such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reward Modeling (RM), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "To know more about how to use Torch XLA and TRL to finetune Gemma, check the **Finetune with Torch XLA** notebook from [Gemma Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook/blob/main/Gemma/Finetune_with_Torch_XLA.ipynb).\n",

    "1. **Create a Hugging Face Account**: If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://huggingface.com/join).\n",

    "3. **Generate a Hugging Face Token**: Go to your Hugging Face [settings page](https://huggingface.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new access token (preferably with `write` permissions). You'll need this token later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to move on to the next section where you'll set up environment variables in your Colab environment.**"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

    "## Important: Training Configuration Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue #225 Fix: Improved Training for Algorithmic Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The original configuration was insufficient for learning algorithmic operations like median calculation. The following improvements have been made:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes Applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Parameters:**\n",
    "- ✅ `num_train_epochs`: Increased from 1 (commented) to **3 epochs**\n",
    "- ✅ `max_steps`: Removed 100-step limit to allow full training\n",
    "\n",
    "**LoRA Configuration:**\n",
    "- ✅ `r` (rank): Increased from 16 to **32**\n",
    "- ✅ `lora_alpha`: Increased from 16 to **64**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why These Changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Training Iterations**: Algorithmic tasks need more examples to learn the underlying logic\n",
    "2. **Higher Model Capacity**: Larger LoRA rank allows learning complex mathematical operations\n",
    "3. **Better Convergence**: Full epoch training ensures the model sees all data multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "With these settings, the model should correctly calculate:\n",
    "- **Input**: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 4, 6, 3, 8]`\n",
    "- **Sorted**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n",
    "- **Median**: **5** (the middle value)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Optimization Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "If accuracy is still insufficient:\n",
    "- Increase to 5-10 epochs\n",
    "- Add more diverse training examples\n",
    "- Increase LoRA rank to 64\n",
    "- Fine-tune learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Impact |\n",
    "|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Training Time | ~3x longer (worth it for accuracy) |\n",
    "| Memory Usage | Slightly higher (still manageable) |\n",
    "| Accuracy | Significantly improved ✓ |\n",
