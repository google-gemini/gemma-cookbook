        "# Model Composition using DeepMind CALM and Gemma\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to this step-by-step guide on fine-tuning the [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) using [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) and DeepMind's **CALM (Composition to Augment Language Models)** framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow ever larger and more capable, it can be both challenging and costly to extend or adapt them to new domains or tasks. Many solutions involve retraining or fine-tuning a large, general-purpose model on new data—a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Moreover, organizational constraints or data privacy concerns may limit access to the original training data needed for such adaptation.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**CALM**](https://github.com/google-deepmind/calm) addresses these challenges by enabling the composition of two distinct language models—an “anchor” model with foundational capabilities and an “augmenting” model specialized in a particular domain—without fully re-training the anchor model. CALM does this by introducing cross-attention between models, allowing you to combine their strengths and preserve their original capabilities. The result is a more capable composed model that leverages existing, proven models and a few additional parameters, rather than building new monolithic models from scratch. The library currently supports combining any two models built with the Gemma architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Transformers**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) is a powerful and versatile tool for working with a wide range of large language models, tokenizers, and pipelines. It offers a user-friendly API for loading, training, and deploying state-of-the-art models, making it an integral component of the machine learning and natural language processing ecosystem. Its broad compatibility, ease of use, and extensive documentation help streamline tasks like fine-tuning, inference, and evaluation of models.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Gemma**](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you'll learn how to fine-tune a Composed LLM (CALM) configuration using the `gemma-2-2b` model as both the anchor and augmentation model. The resulting composed model merges capabilities from both instances of `gemma-2-2b`. You could try other combinations out too (`9B` with `2B`), but you'll be keeping it simple with just the `2B` Gemma variant.\n",
        "\n",
        "What you'll learn:\n",
        "1. **Setup & Dependencies**: Installing and importing necessary libraries.\n",
        "2. **Model & Configuration**: Initializing the CALM configuration with `gemma-2-2b` as anchor and augmentation models.\n",
        "3. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Using an instruction tuning dataset, tokenizing it, and preparing for fine-tuning.\n",
        "4. **Training**: Setting training arguments and running the fine-tuning using the Hugging Face `Trainer`.\n",
