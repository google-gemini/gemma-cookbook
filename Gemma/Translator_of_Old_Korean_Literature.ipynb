In this recipe, we will give the Kraken a cybernetic upgrade with the addition of some high-tech ingredients like LED lights and microchips. \n> \n> **Ingredients:**\n> \n> - 2 pounds of fresh octopus tentacles\n> - 1/2 cup of soy sauce\n> - 1/4 cup of sake or rice wine\n> - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch\n> - 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil\n> - 1/4 cup of LED lights\n> - 1 microchip (optional)\n> \n> **Instructions:**\n> \n> 1. **Prepare the Kraken:** Cut the octopus tentacles into bite-sized pieces. In a bowl, combine the octopus pieces with the soy sauce, sake, cornstarch, and vegetable oil. Toss to coat.\n> \n> \n> 2. **Cyberize the Kraken:** Arrange the octopus pieces on a baking sheet and sprinkle the LED lights over the top. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the LED lights are glowing and the octopus is cooked through.\n> \n> \n> 3. **Microchip enhancement (Optional):** If desired, insert a microchip into one of the octopus pieces before baking. This will give the Kraken a unique ability to glow in the dark.\n> \n> \n> 4. **Serve and enjoy:** Serve the cyberpunk Kraken immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.\n> \n> **Tips:**\n> \n> - For a more realistic effect, serve the cyberpunk Kraken with a side of glowing seaweed or other marine plants.\n> - If you're feeling adventurous, add some chopped chili peppers to the marinade for a spicy kick. \n> - Serve with a side of crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce."
