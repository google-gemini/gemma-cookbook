# Welcome to the Gemma Cookbook
This is a collection of guides and examples for [Google Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/).

## Get started with the Gemma models
Gemma is a family of lightweight, generative artificial intelligence (AI) open models, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. The Gemma model family includes:
* Gemma\
  The core models of the Gemma family.
  * [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card)\
    For a variety of text generation tasks and can be further tuned for specific use cases
  * [Gemma 2](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card_2)\
    Higher-performing and more efficient, available in 2B, 9B, 27B parameter sizes
* Gemma variants
  * [CodeGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/codegemma)\
    Fine-tuned for a variety of coding tasks
  * [PaliGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma)\
    Vision Language Model\
    For a deeper analysis of images and provide useful insights
  * [RecurrentGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/recurrentgemma)\
    Based on [Griffin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427) architecture\
    For a variety of text generation tasks
  * [ShieldGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/shieldgemma)\
    Fine-tuned for evaluating the safety of text prompt input and text output responses against a set of defined safety policies
  * [DataGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/datagemma)\
    Fine-tuned for using Data Commons to address AI hallucinations

You can find the Gemma models on the Hugging Face Hub, Kaggle, Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Garden, and [ai.nvidia.com](https://ai.nvidia.com).
